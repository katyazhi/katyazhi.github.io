# Welcome to my personal page!

I am a PhD student in Weizmann Institute of Science in the [Prof.Semenov's lab](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/Organic_Chemistry/Semenov/home).

I have Specialist's degree in chemistry from Moscow State University. Follow this [link](research.md) for more information about my research interests and background. 

When I am outside of the lab you can find me either [hanging in silks](silks.md) somewhere high in the air or working on my educational courses for high-school students. This term I participate in [WIS Python programming course](python course.md).
