Welcome to my personal page!

I am a PhD student in Weizmann Institute of Science in the Prof.Semenov's lab. 

I have Specialist's degree in chemistry from Moscow State University. Follow this [link](research.md) for more information about my research interests and background. 

When I am outside of the lab you can find me either [hanging in silks](silks.jpg) somewhere high in the air or working on my educational courses for high-school students.
