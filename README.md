Welcome to my personal page!

I am a PhD student in Weizmann Institute of Science in the Prof.Semenov's lab. 

I have Specialist's degree in chemistry from Moscow State University. Follow this link for more information about my reserch interests and background. 

When I am outside of the lab you can find me either hanging in silks somewhere high in the air or working on my educational courses.
